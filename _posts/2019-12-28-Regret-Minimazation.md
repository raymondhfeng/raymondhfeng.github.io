This past summer, Noam Brown of CMU seemingly solved poker with his poker bot, Pluribus. Meanwhile, I had just turned 21, was visiting my dad in Florida. He took me to my first ever poker game with his friends, and I was thoroughly torched.

But before that, I first had to learn about regret minimzation, and computationally finding a Nash Equilibrium.
