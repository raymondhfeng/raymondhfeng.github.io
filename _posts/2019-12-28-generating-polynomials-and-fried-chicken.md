It was a Spring Friday evening in 2018, and it was towards the end of the weekly CS70 staff meeting. Everyone was excited, as the professor usually ordered some pizza for us. This time, however, we got Korean fried chicken, so I must imagine that some billionaire decided to randomly donate to the CS departmental budget. As I am munching on the the fattest drumstick in recent memory, my friend poses the following question:

I think about it for a few seconds, and start writing out the summation of binomial coefficients that sums all probability of even outcomes. Before I can finish though, another friend (the head TA) comes up behind us, thigh in hand, and says:
