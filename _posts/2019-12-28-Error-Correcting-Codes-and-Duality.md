I was browsing twitter early one morning, and I came across this tweet.

It took a while for me to fully understand what the question was asking. So to clarify:

> An 8x8 chessboard starts out with 64 coins laid on it in a random permutation. A person points to a position on the chessboard, say g4 in chess notation (row 4 column 7). You must tell your friend that the pointed to position was g4. The only communication you can do is flipping a single coin on the board. 

Browsing through the comments, I saw that one of the comments said something something "error correcting codes". This gave me an idea.
