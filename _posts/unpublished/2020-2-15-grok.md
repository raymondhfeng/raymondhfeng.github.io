Professor Sahai connected the CRT with the RSA, and it blew my mind. I keep having to relearn stable marriage every year because I don't see the core. 

Exact details don't stay with you, but big ideas and frameworks can be remembered forever. The relationship between the CRT and RSA is how they invented RSA in the first place, but I never completely understood it because I was never introduced this connection. Furthermore, having studied RSA at least 4 times, this connection never revealed itself.
