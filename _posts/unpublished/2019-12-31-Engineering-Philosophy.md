title: Engineering philosophy?

I was interviewing for a company recently, and got to the final onsite interview. Things were looking up, as I whizzed by all the whiteboard problems and the code review, and worked my charisma during lunch. But the final interview of the day was with the CTO of the company, and he asked me what my "engineering philosophy" was. I didn't know how to answer this and kind of diarreah'ed something random.
