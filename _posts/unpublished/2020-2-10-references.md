## Reference Facing

### Dan Mclaughlin
Hi Dan, 

It was a pleasure working with you this summer. Unfortunately, I won't be returning to Keysight full time. I thoroughly enjoyed the project, but a combination of my allergies, and the distance from family/friends push me to mainly recruit in the Bay Area.

I am currently in the interview process with Zeo Capital Advisors LLC, and wanted to ask if you could provide a reference. 

I've tallied a few things that you could possibly talk about our project, since it has been a while since my internship ended. 
- Started with collecting physical modulated signal data
- Prototyped the model in PyTorch
- Bothered Mihai relentlessly to attempt to understand the theoretical side
- Bothered Mohan as well, but abandoned the Linux approach
- Attempted to write code to bring to production by writing C/C++ code that ran the Convolutional Neural Network. Ran out of time. 
- Took crash courses from you in Software Engineering/Architecture. Went down the "run a C based Python compiler on the Field Fox" to just creating a C static Library. 
- Gave a presentation of my work to about 20 people. (public speaking)
- Documented the entire process: https://hackmd.io/209csbQ8TGmSPD4CsbR4fg (attention to detail)

- The company: "Zeo Capital Advisors is a fixed income investment manager who aims to deliver low volatility, risk-managed solutions for the prudent investor."
- The caller: Venk, the Portfolio Manager and Chief Investment Officer
- The position: Trade Operations and Systems Architect

If you're good with this, I'll tell Venk to call you at: (707) 303-6195?

From,
Raymond

I've tallied a few things that you could possibly talk about our project, since it has been a while since my internship ended. 

- Met with Raymond Shen in San Jose on the weekends because I was interested in the TDOA project he was working on. Got somewhat deep into it with Leland, attempting to compile the Matlab/Java, but ultimately ran out of bandwidth. (Initiative)
- Started with collecting physical modulated signal data
- Prototyped the model in PyTorch
- Bothered Mihai relentlessly to attempt to understand the theoretical side
- Bothered Mohan as well, but abandoned the Linux approach

### Satish Rao
Hi Professor Rao, 

I was a TA for your 2019 Spring CS70, and am currently TAing CS70 as well. You might remember me as the lanky kid at the shindigs you always hosted who was really bad a lawn croquet and asked you about that article you wrote in the Daily Cal about "administrative bloat". 

I am currently in the interview process with Zeo Capital Advisors LLC, and wanted to ask if you could provide a reference. 

I've tallied a few things that I think are representative of my dedication to teaching:
- Outside of Head TAs, I was the 2nd contributor to Piazza amongst all 8-hour TAs.
- Here are a few samples of answers on Piazza I am proud of: 
	* https://piazza.com/class/jqq2huwjsw25sy?cid=277 (Isomorphism/CRT Explanation)
	* https://piazza.com/class/jqq2huwjsw25sy?cid=552 (Explaining a midterm solution)
	* https://piazza.com/class/jqq2huwjsw25sy?cid=919 (Explaining subtlety in notes)
- Purchased my own Hagoromo Fulltouch Chalk, the "Fat" chalk you find at MIT, and rehearsed board work for discussion. I did this because I always remembered that as a student, I was annoyed at TAs writing too small. 

If you're good with this, I'll tell Venk to call you at: (510) 642-4328?

From,
Raymond
