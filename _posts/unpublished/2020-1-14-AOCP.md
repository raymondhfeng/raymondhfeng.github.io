## Exercises - Sums and Products - First Set
1. *What does the notation $\sum_{i \leq j \leq n}a_j$ mean if $n=3.14$?* This is equivalent to when $n=3$.
2. Without using $\sum$ notation, write out the equivalent of

## 2.3: Trees
Define: Formally, a tree is a finite set T of one or more nodes such that
a) there is one specially designated node called the root of the tree, root(T)
b) the remaining nodes (excluding the root) are partitioned into $m \geq 0$ disjoint sets $T_1,...,T_m$, and each of these sets in turn is a tree. The trees $T_1,...,T_m$ are called the subtrees of the root.

Binary tree is NOT a specific type of tree, but a different concept entirely. Binary trees can be empty, trees cannot. Why make this distinction?

Ordered: When the order of the subtree matters. Most trees we discuss will be ordered.
Oriented: When the order of the subtree doesn't matter, we only care about the relative orientation of the nodes, not their order. 

## Exercises - Trees
1. *How many different trees are there with three nodes, A, B, and C?*
