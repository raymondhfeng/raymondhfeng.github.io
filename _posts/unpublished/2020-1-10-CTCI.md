I have a phone interview with Mixpanel on Monday. I do really bad on these so I need to practice. I am okay on implementing algorithms once I know the "critical insight", but a lot of times I get stuck on finding that insight. So I figured the best way to practice would be to write down the "critical insight" to each problem, but only actually implement the ones that I believe are tricky to code up. Just in the interest of time. 

 <span style="color:orange">Orange text means that I think I have it somewhat figured it out and would value greatly from actually implementing.</span> 

 <span style="color:red"> Red text means that I have not solved it.</span>

 <span style="color:brown">  Brown text means that I am unsure if this is the fastest or most space efficient way to do it. </span>

 <span style="color:green">  Green text means solved and implemented completely. </span>

 No color means that I solved almost completely and don't feel that I'd gain much from implementing. 

## Chapter 1: Strings

<span style="color:brown"> 1.1 *Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?* Go through the entire string and keep track of characters using a set. If you cannot use additional data structures, then I can think of no faster way than just comparing each of the characters with all the previous characters, leading to a $O(n^2)$ runtime.</span>

<span style="color:orange">1.2 *Implement a function void reverse(char* str) in C or C++ which reverses a null-terminated string.* My C is rusty but I'm assuming that we want to do this in place. We could first find the length of the string and then do $\frac{n}{2}$ swaps using a temp variable.</span>

<span style="color:brown">1.3 *Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.* We could sort both strings and check to see if they are equal, with time complexity $O(n\log{n})$. If we put both into a dictionary and then compare the key-counts, then this would take time ... roughly $O(n)$, but then this depends on the dictionary implementation.</span>

<span style="color:orange"> 1.4 *Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.).* Go through the string. Whenever a space is found, put all "misplaced" characters towards the end of the array. </span>

<span style="color:orange"> 1.5 Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counds of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. Keep a running count of the number of characters "saved". Doing this in place might be tricky. </span>

<span style="color:orange"> 1.6 Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pizel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place? If you didn't need to do it in place, then you could do a matrix multiplication by constructing the rotation matrix and then doing the mulitiplication. If we wanted to do this in place, we would have to go "ring by ring". The indexing is tricky for this one. </span>

1.7 Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0. Traverse the entire matrix, and keep track of the rows and columns that will eventually get zeroed out. When finished, perform the zeroing. 

<span style="color:red"> 1.8 Assume that you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring. Don't know how to do this one...</span>

## Chapter 2: Linked Lists

<span style="color:green"> 2.1 *Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. Follow up, how would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?* With a temporary buffer, just keep track of duplicates and do some pointer stuff. But if you do not have access to a temporary buffer...then as you traverse the list, you need to traverse the rest of the remaining list to check for duplicates, slow $O(n^2)$ time complexity. </span>

<span style="color:brown"> 2.2 *Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list. You could easily do this with two passes, but I'm assuming the question wants to do it in one.* We could keep track of the elements that are k before the current one, and update it every time that we go forward. This has a space complexity of $\theta(k)$, but I don't see how you could do it any faster. </span>

<span style="color:red"> 2.3 *Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.* Take the given middle node, and then change the value to the next node, and then change the pointer to the next next node. </span>

<span style="color:orange"> 2.4 Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. Do we have to do this in place? Keep a pointer to the head of the beginning partition, and the partitioning node will be the head to the second partition. Traverse the list and update as necessary. </span>

<span style="color:orange"> 2.5 You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list. Keep a "carry" variable, and use one of the agrument linked lists as the result linked list.</span>

<span style="color:red"> 2.6 Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns the node at the beginning of the loop. Keep track of the set of already seen nodes. But this would require a buffer. Not sure if you could do this without a buffer. Can't modify the instance variables of the linked list. </span>

<span style="color:red"> 2.7 Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome. Not sure how to do this.</span>

## Chapter 3: Stacks and Queues

3.1 *Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.* Use a modulo 3. 

<span style="color:brown">3.2 *How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop, and min should all operate in $O(1)$ time.* Keep an instance variable that keeps a linked list of the minimum element of the stack up to a new element push, update accordingly. Is there a way to make this use less than $O(n)$ space? </span>

<span style="color:orange">3.3 *Imageine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack). Follow up: Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.* Would this not just entail creating a linked list or an array of stacks? </span>

<span style="color:red"> 3.4 *In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints: (1) Only one disk can be moved at a time. (2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next tower. (3) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk. Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using stacks.* Do some type of recursive branching... </span>

<span style="color:brown"> 3.5 *Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.* Each stack would be responsible for pushing and popping respectively. If you want to push, then push to the push stack. If you want to pop, then you need to unload the push stack to the pop stack, and pop from the pop stack. This would effectively take $\theta(n)$ time per alternating push and pop operation...this is definitely not the most efficient way.</span> 

<span style="color:red"> 3.6 Write a program to sort a stack in ascending order (with biggest items on top). You may use at most one additional stack to hold items, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure (such as an array). The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek and isEmpty. No idea how to do this. </span>

3.7 An animal shelter holds only dogs and cats, and operates on a strictly "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). They cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create a data stucture to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog and dequeueCat. You may use the built in LinkedList data structure. How would a stack help us here? 

## Chapter 4: Trees and Graphs

Keys: Binary tree vs binary search tree, balanced vs unbalanced, full and complete, binary tree traversal, tree balancing with RB and AVL, Trie, Graph Traversal, DFS, BFS <- use a queue.

<span style="color:brown"> 4.1 *Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced, For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.* Return the conjunction of two recursive calls. Base cases are leaf nodes which are vacuously balanced. </span>

<span style="color:green"> 4.2 *Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.* Do DFS from both nodes and check if at least one of them can reach the other. </span>

4.3 *Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unqiue integer elements, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.* Use recursion, have two cases, even and odd length arrays. 

4.4 *Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists).* Same as previous problem except need to add extra step to create the linked lists. 

4.5 *Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.* Should be a textbook algorithm, recursion and base cases. Good problem to practice with. 

<span style="color:red"> 4.6 *Write an algorithm to find the "next" node (i.e., in-order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree. You may assume that each node has a link to its parent.* </span>

4.7 *Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure. NOTE: This is not necessarily a binary search tree.* Do two recursive calls...base case etc. etc. 

<span style="color:orange"> 4.8 *You have two very large binary trees: T1, with millions of nodes, and T2, with hundreds of nodes. Create an algorithm to decide of T2 is a subtree of T1. A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node n in T1 such that the subtree of n is identical to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.* Do two recursive calls with base cases etc etc.</span> 

<span style="color:orange"> 4.9 *You are given a binary tree in which each node contains a value. Design an algorithm to print all paths which sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf.* Should be able to use recursion to solve this relatively easily. </span>

## Chapter 5: Bit Manipulation 

5.1 *You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M=10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j=3 and i=2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.* Not really sure what the insight to this problem is...

5.2 *Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double, print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print "Error".* Forgot how to represent real numbers in binary form.

5.3 *Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that have the same number of 1 bits in the binary representation.* Next smallest: take least significant 1 bit and the next left 0 bit. Flip. Vice versa for other case. 

5.4 *Explain what the following code does: ((n & (n-1)) == 0).* This code checks to see if n is a power of 2. 

5.5 *Write a function to determine the number of bits required to convert integer A to integer B.* Use XOR. 

<span style="color:red"> 5.6 *Write a probgram to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible (e.g., bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, and so on)* </span>

<span style="color:red"> 5.7 *An array A contains all the integers from 0 to n, except for one number which is missing. In this problem, we cannot access an entire integer A with a single operation. The elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use to access them is "fetch the jth bit of A[i]", which takes constant time. Write code to find the missing integer. Can you do it in $O(n)$ time?* Doing this in $O(nlogn)$ time is easy, just manually check all the bits to see which number is missing. Not sure how to do this in linear time though... </span>

<span style="color:red"> 5.8 *A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (taht is, no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course, can be derived by the length of the array and the width. Implement a function drawHorizontalLine(byte[] screen, int width, int x1, int x2, int y) which draws a horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y).* Is this not trivial...? I must be missing something. </span>

## Chapter 6: Brain Teasers

<span style="color:red"> 6.1 *You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles of 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once.* Do we have any other assumptions? </span>

<span style="color:red"> 6.2 *There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board?* </span>

6.3 *You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water. How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Node that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.* Fill the three from the five, leaving 2 in the 5. pour the 2 into the three. Fill the 5 and dump 1 into the 3 until full, leaving 4 in the 5. 

6.4 *A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible. There will be a flight out at 8pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else's eye color, but they do not know their own (nor is anyone else allowed to tell them). Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eyes, although they do know that at least one person does. How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?* Let n be the number of blue eyed people that I see. There are two cases, I am either blue or not blue. In the simplest case, if I am the only blue eyed person, then I will leave in 1 day, because I see no other blue eyed people. If there are two blue eyed people, I will see 1 other blue eyed person, wait 1 day, and see that he has not left. In that case, I must leave, because he sees me. So it will take the total number of blue eyed people days to clear the island of blue eyed people. 

6.5 *There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above, it will break. If it is dropped from any floor below, it will break. You're given two eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.* The worst case is when N = height/2 - 1. 

6.6 *There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway A man begins by opening all 100 lockers. Nex, he closes every second locker. Then, on his third pass, he toggles every third locker. This process continues for 100 passes, such that on each pass i, the man toggles every ith locker. After his 100th pass in the hallway, in which he toggles only locker #100, how many lockers are open?* Count the parity for the number of factors. 

## Chapter 7: Mathemathics and Probability

7.1 <span style="color:green"> *You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games. Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop. Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots. If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other?* $p$ vs. $3p^2(1-p)+p^3$. Solve for $p$. </span>

7.2 *There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of collision (between any two of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction being equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed. Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.* $1-(\frac{1}{2})^n$. The problem becomes more difficult if you have a 3d shape that is not a polygon. 

7.3 *Given two lines on a Cartesian plane, determine whether the two lines would intersect.* Just check their slope ... ? 

<span style="color:red"> 7.4 *Write methods to implement the multiply, subtract, and divide operations for integers. Use only the add operator.* Multiply but adding in a for loop. How do you multiply by a negative number though? </span>

<span style="color:red"> 7.5 *Given two squares on a two-dimensional plane, find a line that would cut these two squares in half. Assume that the top and the bottom sides of the square run parallel to the x-axis.* </span>

<span style="color:red"> 7.6 *Given a two-dimensional graph with points on it, find a line which passes the most number of points.* </span>

<span style="color:red"> 7.7 *Design an algorithm to find the kth number such that the only prime factors are 3, 5, and 7.* I'm assuming that there's a better way than to just use brute force. </span>

## Chapter 8: Object-Oriented Design

I am extremely weak and unconfident in this. Handle ambiguity. Ask clarifying questions and leave nothing to interpretation. Ask who is going to use it and how they are going to use it. The six W's who, what, where, when, how, why. Define the core objects. Analyze relationships. Which objects are members of which other objects? Inheritance? many to many or one to many? Investigate Actions. What actions will the objects do? Design Patterns: Singleton and Factory Method design patterns especially useful for interviews. Singleton class: singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and unsures acces to the instance through the application. Factory method: The Factory Method offers an interface for creating an instance of a class, with its subclasses deciding which class to instantiate. 

8.1 *Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards. Explain how you would subclass the data structures to implement blackjack.*

8.2 *Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager, and director. An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondent who is free. If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must excalate the call to a manager. If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director. Design the classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a method dispatchCall() which assigns a call to the first available employee.*

8.3 *Design a musical jukebox using object-oriented principles.*

8.4 *Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles.*

8.5 *Design the data structures for an online book reader system.*

8.6 *Implement a jigsaw puzzle Design the data structure and explain an algorithm to solve the puzzle. You can assume that you have a fitsWith method in which when passed two puzzle pieces, returns true of the two pieces belong together.*

8.7 *Explain how you would design a chat server. In particular, provide details about the various backend components, classes, and methods. What would be the hardest problem to solve?*

8.8 *Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on the other. Whne a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both the left and right sides, or both the top and bottom, it is said to be captured and its color is flipped. On your turn, you must capture at least one of your opponent's pieces. The game ends when either user has no more valid moves. The win is assigned to the person with the most pieces. Implement the object-oriented design for Othello.*

8.9 *Explain the data structures and algorithms that you would use to design an in-memory file system. Illustrate with an example in code where possible.*

8.10 *Design and implement a hash table which uses chaining (linked lists) to handle collisions.*

## Chapter 9: Recursion and Dynamic Programming

Know how and when to use Bottom-up recursion vs Top-down recursion. Before diving into recursive code, ask yourself how hard it would be to implement it iteratively, and discuss the trade-offs with your interviewer.

9.1 *A child is running up a staircase with n steps, and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.* Create the subproblem $F(n)$, which is defined as the number of ways that the child can reach the end starting $n$ steps from finish. 

9.2 *Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of an X by Y grid. The robot can only move in two directions: right and down. How many possible paths are there for the robot to go from (0,0) to (X,Y)? Follow up: Imageine certain spots are "off limits", such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.* You can use the binomial theorem, but for the follow up, you need to use dynamic programming. Define the subproblem as $F(a,b)$ as the number of ways that you can get to $(x,y)$ starting from $(a,b)$ without using the forbidden set.

<span style="color:red"> 9.3 *A magic index in an array $A[0,...,n-1]$ is defined to be an index such that $A[i]=i$. Given a sorted array of distinct integers, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in array A. Follow up: What if the values are not distinct?* </span>

9.4 *Write a method to return all subsets of a set.* Define the subproblem $F(n)$ as all subsets using the elements up to element $n$. 

9.5 *Write a method to compute all permutations of a string.* 

<span style="color:red"> 9.6 *Implement an algorithm to print all valid combinations of n-pairs of parentheses.* </span>

9.7 *Implement the "paint fill" function that one might see on many image eiditing programs. That is, given a screen (represented by a two-dimensional array of colors), a point, and a new color, fill in the surrounding area until the color changes from the original color.*

9.8 *Given an infinite number of quarters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents) and pennies (1 cent), write code to calculate the number of ways of represnting n cents.* FFT, generating polynomials, look at coefficient. We could possibly use dynamic programming.

<span style="color:red"> 9.9 *Write an algorithm to print all ways of arranging eight queens on an 8x8 chess board so that none of them share the same row, column, or diagnal. In this case, "diagonal" means all diagonals, not just the two that bisect the board.* Not sure about this one. </span>

<span style="color:orange"> 9.10 *You have a stack of n boxes, with widths $w_i$, heights $h_i$, and depths $d_i$. The boxes cannot be rotated and can only be stacked on top of one another if each box in the stack is strictly larger than the box above it in width, height, and depth. Implement a method to build the tallest stack possible, where the height of a stack is the sum of the heights of each box*. Order the boxes in terms of strictly increasing size. Boxes with no strict relationship can be ordered arbitrarily. Then, this becomes the knapsack problem. </span>

<span style="color:red"> 9.11 *Given a boolean expression consisting of the symbols 0, 1, &, |, and ^, and a desired boolean result value result, implement a function to count the number of ways of paranthesizing the expression such that it evaluates to result.* </span>

## Chapter 10: Scalability and Memory Limits 

Can be among the easiest questions. Step 1: Make believe. Pretend that all the data can all fit on one machine and there are no memory limitations. Use this solution as the outline. Step 2: Get real. How much data can you fit on one machine, and what problems will occur when you split the data up? Step 3: Solve problems. Think about how to solve the issues in step 2. The important metrics: Hard drive space, memory, internet transfer latency. Divide up large amounts of data can be done by order of appearance, by hash value, by actual value, or arbitrarily. 

10.1 *Imagine you are building some sort of service that will be called by up to 1000 client applications to get simple end-of-day stock price information (open, close, high, low). You may assume that you already have the data, and you can store it in any format you wish. How would you design the client-facing service which provides the information to client applications? You are responsible for the development, rollout, and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the feed. Describe the different methods you considered and why you would recommend your approach. Your service can use any technologies you wish, and can distribute the information to the client applications in any mechanism you choose.*

10.2 *How would you design the data structures for a very large social network like Facebook or LinkedIn? Describe how you would design an algorithm to show the connection, or path, between two people (e.g Me -> Bob -> Susan -> Jason -> You).*

10.3 *Given an input file with four billion non-negative integers, provide an algorithm to generate an integer which is not contained in the file. Assume you have 1GB of memory available for this task. Follow up: What if you have only 10MB of memory? Assume that all the values are distinct and we now have no more than one billion non-negative integers.*

10.4 *You have an array with all the numbers from 1 to N, where N is at most 32,000. The array may have duplicate entries and you do not know what N is. With only 4 kilobytes of memory available, how would you print all duplicate elements in the array?*

10.5 *If you were designing a web crawler, how would you avoid getting into infinite loops?*

10.6 *You have 10 billion URLs. How do you detect the duplicate documents? In this case, assume that "duplicate" means that the URLs are identical.*

10.7 *Imagine a web server for a simplified search engine. This system has 100 machines to respond to search queries, which may then call out using processSearch(string query) to another cluster of machines to actually get the result. The machine which responds to a given query is chosen at random, so you can not guarantee that the same machine will always respond to the same request. The method processSearch is very expensive. Design a caching mechanism for the most recent queries. Be sure to explain how you would update the cache when data changes.*

## Chapter 11: Sorting and Searching

Radix sort. Bubble sort. Selection sort. Merge sort. Quick sort. Binary search.

<span style="color:red"> 11.1 *You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.* Do some fancy swapping thing to do it in place. </span>

<span style="color:red"> 11.2 *Write a method to sort an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next to each other.* No idea how to do this. </span>

11.3 *Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of times, write code to find an element in the array. You may assume that the array was originally stored in increasing order.*

11.4 *Imagine you have a 20GB file with one string per line. Explain how you would sort the file.*

11.5 *Given a sorted array of strings which is interspersed with empty strings, write a method to find the location of a given string.* 

11.6 *Given a $MxN$ matrix in which each row and each column is sorted in ascending order, write a method to find an element.*

11.7 *A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of peope standing atop one another's shoulders. For practical and aesthetic reasons, each person must be both shorter and lighter than the person below him or her. Given the heights and weights of each person in the circus, write a method to compute the pargest possible number of people in such a tower.* This reminds me of the stacking boxes problem. Seems to be the same idea.

11.8 *Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers. Periodically, you wish to be able to look up the rank of a number x (the number of values less than or equal to x). Implement the data structures and algorithms to support these operations. That is, implement the method track (int x), which is called when each number is generated, and the method getRankOfNumber(int x), which returns the number of values less than or equal to x (not including x itself).*

## Chapter 12: Testing

Four categories: (1) Test a real world object (like a pen) (2) Test a piece of software (3) Write test code for a function (4) Troubleshoot an existing issue. 

What the interviewer is looking for: 

* Big picture understanding. Do you understand what the software is really about? Can you prioritize the test cases properly? i.e. Amazon cares more about reliability of payment as opposed to placement of images.
* Knowing how the pieces fit together. Do you understand how software works, and how it might fit into a greater ecosystem? e.g. Testing Google spreadsheets requires you to test integration with gmail...etc.
* Organization. Do you approach the problem in a structured manner, or do you just spout off anythign that comes to your head? i.e. When testing a camera, break down the test cases into Taking Photos, Image Management, Settings, etc. 
* Practicality. Can you actually create reasonable testing plans? Testing plans need to be feasible and realistic for a company to implement. 

#### Steps for testing
- Step 1: Who will use it? And why?
- Step 2: What are the use cases?
- Step 3: What are the bounds of use?
- Step 4: What are the stress/failure conditions? 
- Step 5: How would you perform the testing?
- Step 6: What are the test cases? How would you perform the testing?

#### Testing a Piece of Software
- Manual vs. Automated Testing
- Black Box Testing vs. White Box Testing
- Step 1: Define the test cases. The normal case, the extremes, nulls and "illegal" input, and strange input. 
- Step 2: Define the expected result. 
- Step 3: Write test code

#### Troubleshooting Questions
- Step 1: Understand the Scenario
- Step 2: Break down the problem
- Step 3: Create Specific, Manageable Tests

12.1 *Find the mistake(s) in the following code:*

12.2 *You are given the source to an application which crashes when it is run. After running it ten times in a debugger, you find it never crashes in the same place. The application is single threaded, and uses only the C standard library. What programming errors could be causing this crash? How would you test each one?*

12.3 *We have the following method ued in a chess game: boolean canMoveTo(int x, int y). This method is part of the Piece class and returns whether or not the piece can move to a position (x,y). Explain how you would test this method.*

12.4 *How would you load test a webpage without using any test tools?*

12.5 *How would you test a pen?*

12.6 *How would you test an ATM in a distributed banking system?*
