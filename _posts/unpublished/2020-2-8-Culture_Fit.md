## Questions
- What do you value most at work?
- What do you like most about working on a team?
- Can you give an example of when you went out of your way to help a coworker create a postive experience for a customer?

## It's a two way street
- Candidates should demonstrate their capabilities and values
- Interviewers must clearnly define the culture and hit home on on culture
	* Emphasize core customer service ethos, how company recognizes achievement, and certain expectations for working overtime on weekends. 

## What culture is not
- Diversity is important
- Culture fit is not discouting certain lifestyles because they do not align with your values.
- Don't necessarily want to build a team that will act and think the same way


## My Thoughts
- Upon my initial review, it seems that the main goal of the "culture fit" is to determine whether or not someone will:
	* Pull more, equal, or less than his/her own weight. 
	* Ultimately, you want people who will go above and beyond and provide more than his/her market value for this position. 

## Big Idea
- "At its core, cultural fit means that employees' beliefs and behaviors are in alignment with their employer's core values and company culture." No shit Sherlock. 
- "...we need to hire people who genuinely care about the people they work with and for and not hire those who show up to work every day just to collect a paycheck. Employers simply can’t take a chance on someone who won’t mesh well with the existing team, doesn’t share common goals with their colleagues, and are not aligned with the mission of the company."
	* Interesting point. Most, if not all people are indeed working mainly to collect a paycheck. However, there is one quote that comes to mind. 
	* "You can never excel at something that you don't think about in the shower."
	* In order to excel, you need something more than monetary incentives.
	* Employees must, at least at the high level, agree with how the company operates. 

## Game Theoretic
- Sometimes the culture questions are canned, both the questions and the responses. 
- Want to show passion by their actions. oh 

Interesting "Culture" statement found on the Heap page. 
- Vision > GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee -- these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.
- Writing > Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.
