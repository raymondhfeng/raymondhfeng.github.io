These problems are from Heard on the Street and Xinfeng Zhou's book. 

## Heard on the Street

1.1 *You are given two glass jugs. Each contains the same volume, V, of liquid. One jug contains pure alcohol, and the other jug contains pure water. A modest quantity, Q, of water is poured from the water jug into the alcohol jug, which is now thoroughly mixed. The same modest quantity, Q, of (now diluted) alcohol is then poured back into the water jug to equalize the volumes of the jugs at their initial levels. The initial concentration of alcohol in the alcohol jug equals the initial concentration of water in the water jug (at 100%). What is the relationship between the final concentrations of alcohol in the alcohol jug and water in the water jug?* After the first pour we have a concentration of $\frac{Q+V}{V}$ in the alcohol. We know that the total concentration must be $\frac{1}{2}$, and so this means that $\frac{Q+V}{V}+X = 1$. Thus $X=\frac{Q}{V}$. 

1.2 What is the sum of the integers from 1 to 100? $101(50)=5050$. 

1.3 You are given a set of scakes and 12 marbles. The scales are of the old balance variety. That is, a small dish hangs from
