The EECS department has to pay $5.3 million in retroactive fee remission. This means that in future semesters, there can only be at most half the current number of teaching assistants for most if not all classes. 

Professor Sahai is then prompting the TAs to do some extra homework part hosts, CSM infrastructure, course infrastructure, problem bank type stuff for two reasons. 

1. Inflate the value of course staff
2. There will be no money to do this next semester
