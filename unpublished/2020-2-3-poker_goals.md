### Background
- Started poker May 22nd, 2019, my 21st birthday. 
	* Got torched twice at my dad's home game. 
- Started playing on Ignition Casino
	* Burned many a Buy in
- Started reading "Harrington on Cash Games"
	* Started reading Mike Matteo's "Fundamentals of Playing online Texas Hold 'em"
	* Texas Hold 'em for Dummies
	* "The mental game of poker"
- Purchased and installed Poker Tracker 4
- Currently grinding at 0.02/0.05 microstakes as of Febuary 3rd, 2020. 

### Game Plan
- Goal: Side income. $10,000 USD/Year. 
	* Time frame: Within 2 Years. 
	* Will need to transition to $1/3 Live games. 
	* Very ambitious, and $10,000 is not a life changing amount of money. 
- Action: How to get there?
	* Ignition 2/5NL Zone is probably not where I should be. 
	* Be more disciplined with bankroll management


### Progress (Statistics)
- Graph of time spent playing
- Overall money trend

### Is it worth it?
- Poker is not scaleable, and has extremely high variance. 
- Anything more than a ~$10,000
